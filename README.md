This is a posterity project.  As with all of my posterity projects, t was built for a previous (open source) employer.  I was given permission by my supervisor to post this for portfolio and learning purposes.  If you represent the employer in question and the stance has changed, please contact me to have this taken down!

Because of its posterity status, parts of the code have been redacted - sometimes heavily.  It is very unlikely this will run out of the box.

This project provides a web frontend for a cobbler install on a pxe system.  All of the cobbler-specific information was redacted.  Major chunks of the web backend has also been redacted for security reasons.

Not much to see here - it's a bit hardcoded (as it was not built to be redistributable), but it worked beautifully.
